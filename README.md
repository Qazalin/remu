## Intro

Remu is an RDNA3 emulator built to test correctness of RDNA3 code. It is used in [tinygrad's AMD CI](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad).

The code for Remu has been [upstreamed to tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/tree/master/extra/remu). This repo will remain for releases.
